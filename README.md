**REST Countries API using ReactJs-SAAS**

About

This is an application that gives some information about all countries in the world.

Application let's user to:

Search for a specific country
Filter countries by region
Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
Click through to the border countries on the detail page
Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode ( initially, it auto-detects user's preference. )

Built With
[React] (https://reactjs.org/)
[React Router] (https://reactrouter.com/)
[create-react-app] (https://create-react-app.dev/)
[Rest Countries API] (https://restcountries.eu/)
[CSS Modules] (https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)

**Running The App**
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

**Future Steps**

Add a map which would focus on the country that user views, probably using React Leaflet.
Display more specific data related to countries.
Optimize performance using react-virtual
