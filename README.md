**REST Countries API using ReactJs-SAAS**

This is an application that gives some information about all countries in the world.

Application let's user to:

Search for a specific country
Filter countries by region
Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
Click through to the border countries on the detail page
Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode ( initially, it auto-detects user's preference. )
